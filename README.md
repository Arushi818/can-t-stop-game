# About the project
This project was developped in a group of 5 as part of my Software Engineering course over the Winter 2023 semester. 
We implemented the iterative model to develop this project. We had to repeatedly implement and test, providing necessary documentation as we progressed in the project.
It was a fun teamwork exercise and I learned a lot while collaborating with others.
